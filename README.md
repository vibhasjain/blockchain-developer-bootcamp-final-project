I'd like to use GPT3 to let the community create a story together. Every day users will get to mint one new sentence in the story and vote on the best sentence. All user submissions get minted as NFT's and the chosen submission becomes valuable. It becomes more valuable as the story progresses. In the beginning only 10 user submissions are allowed (one per wallet) and this increases by 10% everyday. It costs only gas to mint. While minting their sentence, users get to send one word to GPT3 to direct the sentence. Eventually community members can illustrate/animate the story and its characters, creating further value. The intent is to engage and enthral a growing community of people with a single storyline, while making everyone feel like a contributor. The art generated in this project should be very valuable as long as there is a hyper engaged group of people around it.

**Concept:**

1. Let the community build a story together, one sentence at a time.
2. Start with a sentence, which the team mints.
3. Every day, let users mint the next sentence, by passing one word to the contract. The contract then uses GPT3 to render the sentence and mint it as an NFT to the users wallet.
4. The community votes on what the best sentence is.
5. The winner gets to mint a special NFT which signifies that they won that round.
6. The story unfolds in this manner, one sentence per day.

**Why build this?**

1. This is a story that the community is building together. It's engaging, interactive and also allows for financial gain.
2. The winning NFT's for each round can be valuable.
3. We can further allow illustrators to make illustrations for the winning sentence which the winner can mint and trade.

**Hypothesis**

1. Users are able to make money with their creative ideas
2. As more people come into the platform, value of older generation stories increases

**Revenue Model**

1. Each mint costs 0.01 ETH. 
2. Each NFT traded give us a commission

**What does it need to succeed?**

1. Needs to capture the community's attention
2. Story needs to be entertaining
3. The story NFT's need to be valuable

**Things to validate**

1. People give a shit about this. If this is released to 100 people, 
    1. How many of them create a story? 
    2. How many vote? 
    3. How many talk about it on Twitter?
    4. Do the NFT's become valuable?
2. GPT3 is capable of stitching together an interesting story and they give us permission to build this

**MVP**

1. Used internally by 20 people
2. Build a story using GPT3, let people vote.
3. Airdrop the winning story to winners wallet

**Doubts**

1. Why do people need to spend gas to vote?
2. Maybe instead only the top 10 winners get to mint their NFT's
    1. If they don't mint within 24 hours, NFT's are put up to auction
3. Why just one story? There should be unlimited concurrent stories
4. How can we make these stories come to life with visuals?
    1. Can we commission illustrators to illustrate the top 3 winners and airdrop to them everyday?
    This wouldn't cost much and would definitely make me want to participate.
    2. Maybe everyday the story branches into three?
